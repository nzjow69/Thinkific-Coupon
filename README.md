## Real People, Real Stories with Thinkific

Let me tell you about some real folks who used Thinkific‚Äîit‚Äôs so inspiring!

Source: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cuuw91/anyone_ever_used_thinkific_for_an_online_course/):

Jane the Baker: Jane‚Äôs a mom who loves cookies. She started on the Free plan, made a ‚ÄúCookie Magic‚Äù course, and earned $100,000! She used Thinkific‚Äôs video tools to show every step kneading dough, adding sprinkles, everything.

Source: [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/675a8377eaf8e8cfdc006691):

‚ÄúThe best e-learning software I've experienced, the free forever tier is the best for anyone to learn the how-tos of thinkific without having to pay for subscription fees, unlike others, you need to pay after 14 days if you haven't fully understood the system. Secondly, Thinkific software is simplified, so you'll be able to start creating your course in 30 days or less. Thirdly, once you've completed creating your course on the free tier, you may select the additional features that you want to have on your course site by subscribing to the paid tier of your choice. No other software has the flexibility that Thinkific can offer.‚Äù

These people started small, just like you might. With Thinkific deals, they turned dreams into real stuff. You could too!

## Thinkific vs. Other Tools: Why It Wins

You might wonder, ‚ÄúWhat about Teachable or Kajabi?‚Äù Good question!

Here‚Äôs how Thinkific stacks up:

1. Thinkific: Free plan with no fees, unlimited students, and Thinkific savings like 25% off. Super easy to use!
2. Teachable: Starts at $39/month (no free plan forever), charges fees unless you pay more. Good, but not as cheap.
3. Kajabi: Fancy, but pricey‚Äîstarts at $149/month. Great for big businesses, not beginners.

Thinkific‚Äôs free plan and offerings make it the winner for newbies like us.

Plus, it‚Äôs less confusing. I tried Teachable once and got lost in buttons!

## Make Your Thinkific Course Shine

Once you‚Äôve got your plan with a Thinkific promo code, here‚Äôs how to make it amazing:

* Check Analytics: Thinkific shows you who‚Äôs watching your course. If lots of people stop at Lesson 3, maybe make it more fun!
